    <h1> Perks of not going to college </h1>
      <p> People say going to college is a great thing and can help you earn a 6
        digit salary. This is not wrong, college can help you get a 6 digit salary
        but it can also give a 6 digit debt to pay off. Plus, add in the interest,
        bills, food, miscellanious, and etc. It is going to take awhile to pay
        it off, unless you're part of the 1% who are filthy rich and can pay it
        off almost instantly. Like Trump.</p>

    <h2> Hypothetical </h2>
      <p>Think about what if you didn't go to college. Yes, you'll most likely
        start small and earn a minimum wage of $11 per hour, but if you started
        early it can be avoided.Think about it, minimum age to work is 15 years
        old if you have a workers permit and high school graduates are usually
        around 18 years old. If you started work during high school at 15 years
        old, you would have 3 years to get a raise and possibly a promotion if
        you work hard enough. Though the "work hard" part seems impossible, you
        would need to work hard anyways in college, and the best part about
        doing it during high school and at work is that it's free! Another thing
        to think about is connections. Simply put, getting a job and be very
        commited to that job is the connection to that company versus being in
        college and applying for internship which is a lot harder.</p>
    <h2> The Math </h2>
      <p> A typical college tuition cost roughly around $30,000 without the
        unnecessary fees they add onto the tuition without the actual students'
        choice, weather they want it or not. Take to UPASS for instance, what if
        the student dorms (roughly cost $6000-$18000)? The UPASS itself cost
        about $130, that it approximately 1.5 days of work assuming you work 8
        hours a day and no tax taken off.</p>
