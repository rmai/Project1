  <h1> So here I go... (A mini random autobiography of me, Randy)</h1>
  <body>
    <p> When was the last time I wrote any tags? That would be either my
      freshmen year or sophomore year in highschool. Of course then it was much,
      much simpler than now. How? Who knows, maybe because the highschool teacher
      (I forgot her name) taught slowly so everything sank in easier. Well
      anyways, I am stuck writing this again and hopefully the stuff I learned
      4 or 5 years ago will kick in eventually. Oh, I forgot to mention, whoever
      is reading this, bare with me, this is my first project for ITMD 361.</p>

    <p> Oh guys look! I just inserted a picture. According to this website I use
      to give me the tag it says that I have to do the following before I get
    in trouble</p>
    <ol>
      <li>I have to own the image.</li>
      <li>I have to receive explicit, written permission from the image's owner</li>
      <li>I have to have ample proof that the image is, in fact, in the public domain.</li>
    </ol>
    <p> Well since I cannot do 1 and 2 my only option is 3 then. I need to have
      ample proof that the image is public....hmmmm... can't I just post this
      URL: http://www.operationworld.org/files/ow/maps/lgmap/fran-MMAP-md.png and
      everything be okay. I mean I did get the picture from google images and that
      is the URL they gave me, so everything should be fine now.</p>
    <h2> The huge picture above</h2>
    <body>
      <p> See that picture on your screen? The only one on this website. Well that
        is France (as said in the picture). Well I chose this picture because talking
        about highschool made me remember the good old days. Well, in highschool the
        only subject that I took all four years were math, french (hint, hint, wink,
        wink) and P.E. So obviously those memory will be more vivid than the rest,
        and based on these three subjects french class was my most favorite. Not only
        did I learned french (any forgot after highschool) but I got to watch
        nondocumentary movies in that class. So that's why I chose the picture of
        France up there.</p>
